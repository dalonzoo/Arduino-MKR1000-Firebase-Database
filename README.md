![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) `saveDataFunction.js` is an HTTP function written in NodeJs using Firebase function.
Once you uploaded your function on whatever server you want (Firebase in my case), you can modify ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) `readData.ino` according to your parameters and what you want to save from Arduino
to Firebase database.
